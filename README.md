# <div align="center"> Test-Driven Data Structures </div>

<p>Level up your fundamental javascript and computer science concepts to ace that technical interview or pass all that leisure time you don't have. </p>

## <div align="center"> Why? </div>

<p>Sure... you could use HackerRank, CodeWars, or one of the many other platforms for interview prep.  In fact, you should probably be doing that too!  The real world demand for test-driven development and collaborative coding is a "thing" though, so fork this repo and submit new challenges and mocha tests. Who doesn't want to learn more TDD and git/gitHub concepts?</p>

## <div align="center"> How? </div>

<p>This is to benefit me just as much as it's meant to benefit you.  I'll be adding contribution guidelines in the near future, but in the meantime, set up your environment and get started:</p>

### The lazy way... don't be lazy:
```
git clone https://github.com/cpalmer-atx/js-data-structures.git
```

### The other way:
1. Fork this repo by smashing that fork button above. :point_up:
2. Clone the forked repo the lazy way now located in your github repositories.
3. Track the original repo (this copy) remotely:
    ```
    git remote add --track main upstream https://github.com/cpalmer-atx/js-data-structures.git
    ```
    ```
    git fetch upstream
    ```
4. Create a new branch for each contribution, bonus points if the name clearly describes your new feature that you wish to share with the world. Negative points if your branch is called clever-branch-name.
    ```
    git checkout -b clever-branch-name upstream/main
    ```
5. Make contributions to your local copy.  Once you've saved them, add and commit as usual.
    ```
    git add .
    ```
    ```
    git commit -m "clever commit message goes here"
    ```
6. Push changes to your working branch. This may be a new concept if you've worked exclusively on the main/master branch by yourself... until now.
    ```
    git push -u origin clever-branch-name
    ```
7. You're ready to submit a pull request!  [Click here](https://github.com/cpalmer-atx/js-data-structures) to return to my copy of this repo and smash the 'Compare & pull request' button.  Standby for PR title and description format.  Until then, I'll likely reject your otherwise amazing contributions.
8. Finally, you'll want to make sure you're working with the most up-to-date version of this repo each time you open it and after every pull request.  Nobody likes merge conflicts.
    ```
    git pull upstream main
    ```
